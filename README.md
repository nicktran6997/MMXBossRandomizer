# MMX Boss Randomizer
Basically a fun little GUI boss randomizer for those trying to re-experience the MMX games in different ways. Since the game's difficulty and "feeling" can vary depending on what stages are chosen, this randomizer will choose a set order of what stages you should play which may increase the challenge significantly. Also has other options such as buster-only, number of armor parts allowed etc

There's two ways to use my application: the easier way is to use the .exe file inside the dist folder. Recommended for those who don't have Python installed. An alternative way is to enter this command

```
python mmx_boss_randomizer.py
```
Just note that Python2 must be installed for the script to work.
