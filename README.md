# MMXBossRandomizer
Basically a fun little GUI boss randomizer for those trying to re-experience the MMX games in different ways. Since the game's difficulty and "feeling" can vary depending on what stages are chosen, this randomizer will choose a set order of what stages you should play which may increase the challenge significantly. Also has other options such as buster-only, number of armor parts allowed etc
